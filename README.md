# Amazon-Scraper
A web scraper for Amazon developed in Python using the Selenium and BeautifulSoup packages for TAMU Datathon 2021. It finds the average price of up to the first twenty pages of listings matching a user-specified search term, produces a bar chart with the price distribution of those listings, and outputs the title, price, rating, and review count of each listing to a .csv file.
